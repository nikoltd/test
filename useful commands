clone existing VM's LV
Check to see if there is enough space on the hyper-visor, using vgs, lvs, pvs.
lvcreate -n mcqt-mess02-ktst --size 20G vg2
dd if=/dev/vg2/mcqt-mess01-kst of=/dev/vg2/mcqt-mess02-kst bs=64k
create a virsh xml config file, this can be done by copying existing config of another guest and editing it
cd /etc/libvirt/qemu/
cp mcqt-mess01-kst.xml mcqt-mess02-kst.xml
vi mcqt-mess02-kst.xml
edit virsh xml so it has a uniqe uuid and mac address, also configure required resources e.g memory or vcpu
Connect to VM using virtual machine manager and boot the vm using a live CD. This enables us to mount the LV we created and edit its sysconfig to use the new mac address and ip.
vgscan to see available volume groups, add in all of the available VG's
vgchange -a y
When you use fdisk -lu
I am able to get the correct partition of the newly visible LV in this case the lv partition to use is
/dev/mapper/root-rootfs
I then create a mount point and mount the lv partition
mkdir /tmp/lv
mount /dev/mapper/root-rootfs /tmp/lv
From here we change IP address and mac address in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth, these changes will need a shutdown/startup to take effect.
Also change hostname, and welcome message.
